          Books are a unique form of investment â€” they require both money to
          obtain and, more valuably, time to read. If books truly are
          investments, consider this my portfolio.

          <strong>The Tsundoku</strong> refers to the Japanese term that
          describes the art of acquiring books and letting them pile up for
          future reading. Here, I&apos;ve listed the books waiting patiently on
          my &quot;to-read&quot; shelf. This list will evolve as I discover new
          titles and finally crack open others.
