[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a flexible React framework from Vercel, it gives you building blocks to create fast web applications. You can choose to build your web application in either a server-side rendering paradigm or in a static site generation way.

Recently [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) announced a newer router for Next.js, the “App Router” which allows you to use React’s latest features, such as the Server Components and Streaming. I’ve made this website, jshamsul.com a while back with Next.js using its original router, the “Pages Router”.  This website is static. I practically just created it once and that is all. No new content was added. Did not use much of the Next.js features, basically used it as a static site generator.

The “Next” in the title of this post is really not about Next.js, it is really about what I plan to do next with this little site that I have. Now that I finally have some spare time, I thought I might as well do a revamp, with the excuse to try out the new App Router. And this time around I do plan to write regularly here, or at least try. Just like a log of sorts, but on the web, perhaps I can call it a “weblog”, or a shorter version, a “blog”.

I contemplated for quite some time about starting a blog. As someone who had gone through the “blogosphere” era during the late 90s and early 2000s, I am hesitant to get back to writing online. I had several somewhat successful blog sites back then. By “successful” here, what I mean is, the blogs that I maintained generated a few hundreds of dollars in Google AdSense. I know this is laughable by today's standard of online revenue, but for a university student back at that time, this was something.

I was obsessed with watching my page views metrics, tweaking things for search engine optimisations (SEO), trying hard to fish for any sort of traffic I can get. Furthermore, I’ve used other website traffic generating tactics which I am not proud of. Everything just to squeeze a bit more page views, to get a bit more ad impression.

It didn’t start out that way in the beginning. I started a blog because I did enjoy writing, although I wasn’t any good at it back then. By writing and publishing online, I hope to improve my writing skills. At first, I only wrote things that I am passionate about, things that I feel strongly about. That slowly changed, desperate for page views, I just wrote whatever that was trending at that time, just creating content for the sake of having content. I wrote about things in which I have no knowledge of. I was just “bullshitting”.

There are already so many bullshits everywhere, why would I want to add more? In Harry G. Frankfurt’s book On Bullshit, he mentioned that “bullshit” is unavoidable whenever circumstances require someone to talk without knowing what he is talking about. But, what are the circumstances in which require someone to elaborate on matters of which they are to some degree ignorant? In the book it mentioned that it is the widespread conviction that, as a responsible citizen in a democratic society, they need to have opinions about everything.

While that may have been true to some extent a few years back, I think the “bullshit” phenomena has worsened in the present time. Nowadays, people feel the need to express their opinions about everything, not because they believe that it is what a responsible citizen of a democratic society should do, nowadays, it is more about getting attention. Desperate for the views, they are quick to share things that they may not have knowledge about.

In his book, “bullshit” is different from the act of lying. To tell a lie, you’ll need to know the truth so that you can tell a different statement which you know is false. To bullshit is to not bother with the truth. This lack of care about being truthful is to me far more dangerous than telling a like. It does not matter if the opinion that you shared does not in any way reflect the reality of the situation, what matters is that you have shared your opinion. 

So what made me decide to start writing? I stumbled on this quote by Pramoedya Ananta Toer,

> Orang boleh pandai setinggi langit, tapi selama ia tidak menulis, ia akan hilang di dalam masyarakat dan dari sejarah. Menulis adalah berkerja untuk keabadian.

A man can be brilliant as high as the sky, but as long as does not write, he will disappear from society and history. To write is to work for posterity. 

To write is to work for posterity, that really struck a chord with me. But let's be honest, writing on this website that nobody visits, I would not expect much posterity from it. So why bother? 

I am fortunate to be living in this digital age. Writers in the digital age have one advantage than the writers of a different time. In this digital age, we could write and publish quickly to test and put out our ideas. Writing here is like an experimental training ground of sorts for me. 

To make sure that I do not go back to the days of metric-driven content, I won't add any intrusive analytic tracker. Not going to delve deeply on page views and link referrals and anything like that sorts.
