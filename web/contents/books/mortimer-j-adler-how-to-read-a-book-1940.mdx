I read the revised 1972 edition that Mortimer J. Adler co-authored with Charles Van Doren first before actually reading the 1940s edition. The main core premise of both book is the same. 

Both provide guidance to active reading, the skill needed to fully engage with complex texts. Both books highlight in details the different levels of reading â€” elementary, inspectional, analytical, and syntopical reading.

However, I do prefer the 1940s edition. I find it to be more philosophical and focused on the humanities. The insights are timeless, and are still very much relevant today.
