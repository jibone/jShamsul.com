I like this one more than [1984](/bookshelf/george-orwell-1984). Animal Farm might not be as popular or widely known as 1984, but I do think the story theme is the most relevant in current times, in political climate all over the globe.

“The road to hell is paved with good intentions”, the animals’ rebellion against the human farmer, started out with good, pure intentions. However, those ideas were corrupted once the pigs got into the positions of power. Maybe perhaps those pigs were already corrupt, and they used the noble ideas to gain support from other animals so that they can get themselves into the positions of power.

The pigs wrote the 7 commandments, of which one of it was “All animals are equal”, this was later towards the end, changed to, “All animals are equal, some animals are more equal than others.”

Also, checkout [1984](/bookshelf/george-orwell-1984).
