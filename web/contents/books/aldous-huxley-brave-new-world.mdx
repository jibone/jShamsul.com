A chilling look at a future where comfort is engineered, freedom is sacrificed for stability, and human lives are shaped by algorithms long before birth. In Huxley’s world, happiness is mandatory, critical thinking is obsolete, and society runs like a perfectly tuned machine—with no room for error, or individuality. Though written nearly a century ago, it reads like a blueprint for the age of biotech, social scoring, and curated realities. A must-read for anyone tracing the lineage of modern dystopias.
