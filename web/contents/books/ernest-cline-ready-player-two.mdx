What made me want to read this?

I did enjoy the ride while reading [Ready Player One](/bookshelf/ernest-cline-ready-player-one), of course I would want to have more of it. Although Ready Player Two feels like it is repeating the same gimmick from Ready Player One, only with the higher stakes, I did still enjoy it.

This time with a fully immersive headset technology that lets you feel everything in the game, think [Sword Art Online](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_Art_Online), but you can still log out. Wade is still going around solving puzzles with 80s and 90s nostalgia clues.
