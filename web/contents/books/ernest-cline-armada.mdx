When you were young, at school in the middle of a boring class, have you ever day-dream that a helicopter would land on your school filed and men in black suits will jump out, go to your class and say that they need your help to save the world. Well, I do, all the time at school, and this is basically the plot of Armada.

Alien are coming to attack earth, and earth requires skilled drone pilots to control the swarm of drones to fan off the invading aliens. The thing is, the government has been conducting training for pilots, in a form of a popular video games that everyone is playing. The video game that the main character is very good at.

Imagine that the countless hours you put into that game youâ€™ve been playing all this time are not all wasted, intact that is what going to save the earth and humanity from the impending doom. One could dream.
