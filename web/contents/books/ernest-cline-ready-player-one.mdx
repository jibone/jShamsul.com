This book has the young teenage in me all excited. VR headsets in an immersive digital world, with easter-eggs that could lead you to real-world fortune, is what the young nerdy and geeky me dreamt about. I remember thinking to myself that it is like Indiana Jones meets TRON.

I love all the throwbacks to 80s pop culture references, from video games, to movies and tv shows, to music, and technology. As a cyberpunk fan, the blend of nostalgia and advance tech adds a unique twist, merging retro and futuristic dystopia.

There is a follow-up to this book â€” [Ready Player Two](/bookshelf/ernest-cline-ready-player-two)
