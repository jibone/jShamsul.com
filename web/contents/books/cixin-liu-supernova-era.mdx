After finishing Cixin Liu’s Remembrance of Earth Past trilogy; [Three-Body Problem](/bookshelf/cixin-liu-the-tree-body-problem), [Dark Forest](/bookshelf/cixin-liu-dark-forest), and [Death’s End](/bookshelf/cixin-liu-death-s-end), made me curious about this other works.

Supernova Era has an interesting plot. Seems like Cixin Liu likes to put humanity in difficult situations, and in this book it is no different. A cosmic event happened, and a star died, sending deadly radiation waves to earth. All adults above 13 years of age will die in a year’s time. Those under 13, the children, they will survive the radiation. They will need to run the world. A world without adults. 

I’ve written a commentary (with spoilers) about how I feel about the book — When Children Rule the World.
