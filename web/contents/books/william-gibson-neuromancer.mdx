What made me want to read this?

It was in the late 90s, and I was a teenager finishing high-school. The Internet was just about to go mainstream. I found myself intrench in the hacker culture and cyberpunk culture. One book that was popular among them was, William Gibson’s Neuromancer.

This book sets the futuristic setting of immersive virtual worlds, AI gone rouge, console cowboys hackers saving the day. This stirs up my juvenile techno geek mind. Neuromancer is often credited as the book that first coined the term Cyberspace.

Re-reading it in today’s context had given me a different perspective, I've written about it in my short essay, [Cyberspace and Metaverse](/essays/2024-07-19-cyberspace-and-metaverse).
