What made me want to read this?

My journey into Cixin Liu's expansive universe began unexpectedly with a film adaptation of his short story, "The Wandering Earth." The movie's mind-bending premise - Earth being physically moved through space to escape a dying sun - was just simply unheard of.

Captivated by his imaginative storytelling, I did some research and discovered that his magnum opus was the trilogy, “Remembrance of Earth’s Past”, but this trilogy is more famously known by the first book, which is - The Three-Body Problem.

This grand trilogy spans millennia, weaving together numerous groundbreaking sci-fi concepts, dimensional warfare, cosmic sociology, deterrence theory, to just name a few.

The first book itself sets the foundation if what to come. What started out from in incident during the cultural revolution in China, cascaded in a dominos like effect that effected the fate of the entire humanity.
