What made be want to read this?

I would have not thought that ideas could be bigger and crazier than the second book from the ‘Remembrance of Earth Past’ trilogy — Dark Forest. I was wrong. 

Death’s End culminates in a cosmic-scale narrative that challenges our understanding of space, time, and existence. It is no longer between the humans of earth and the Trisolarians. Other galactic civilisations have managed to weaponise physics, and there are dimensional warfares being fought in other regions of the vast galaxy.

This book makes you think deeply about the universe, civilisation, and our place in the cosmos.
