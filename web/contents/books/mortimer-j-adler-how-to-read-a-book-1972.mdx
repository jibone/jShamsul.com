This is the revised and updated version, with a new subtitle — “The Classic Guide to Intelligent Reading”. I find this version to be more practical and less philosophical than the earlier version. 

This book gives a set of guidance on how to be an active reader that engaged in what the reader is reading. It goes through the difference levels of reading, from elementary reading, to inspectional reading, to analytical reading, and lastly syntopical reading.

It teaches you on how to be a demanding reader, and the importance of reading as a means of learning.

I would also like to suggest you checkout the 1940s edition of [How to Read a Book](/bookshelf/mortimer-j-adler-how-to-read-a-book-1940).
