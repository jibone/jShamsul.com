I did not know what I was jumping into, the book looks to be a short read, but in the end it made me reflect and contemplate on the impact of “non-things” on us all.

The book examines how our world has shifted from being centred around a tangible, physical object to being dominated by intangible, virtual and digital phenomena. He calls these as “Non-things”. 

In the modern age that we live in, traditional “things” are being replaced with “Non-things” — data, algorithms, and digital information. Objects used to be meaningful, nowadays, objects are informatons — information processing units — tools for us to consume more information and tools that send out more information out.

“Non-things” is a philosophical critique and a warning about the consequences of living in a world dominated by data and digital technology. The book asks its readers to reflect on what we have lost as we transition from the world of “things” to the world of “non-things”.
