On Truth is the follow-up to Harry G. Frankfurt’s earlier work, [On Bullshit](/bookshelf/harry-g-frankfurt-on-bullshit). While _On Bullshit_ explores the rise of the phenomenon in society that has become indifference to truth, On Truth serves as its companion piece.

In On Bullshit, he observed that the reason bullshit has become so prevalent — back in 2005 when the essay was first published, it is even more prevalent today — was the lack of concern in society to what is truthful. In this book, On Truth, he talks about why truth is important.

Although both books were written in 2005 and 2006, all the things said are even more applicable today (2025).
