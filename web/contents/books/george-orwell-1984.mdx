This is one of those books that has been referenced a lot in pop culture that without actually reading it most people already have an idea what it is about. The tagline such as “Big Brother is Watching you” is often used to reference a totalitarian state where citizens are constantly being surveilled.

The book is not what most people — those who have not read it, and only have an idea of what it is about based on popular references (I was one of those people) — think it is. There are layers of rich and dark ironies written all over the book.
