This is the second book of the trilogy, “Remembrance of Earth’s Past”. The first book, “The Three-Body Problem” ended in a cliffhanger. 

In the midst of despair, as humanity had lost all hope, that “locus” scene at the end of Three-body Problem, to me, was so inspiring. I just had to continue with the second book as soon as I finished the first one.

In the book Dark Forest, expands the scope to galactic proportions. Creates a nice though exercise on cosmic sociology. Many big ideas was presented in this book among then is Game Theory at a galactic universal scale.
