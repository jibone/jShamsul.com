![Digital Sufism](/imgs/essays/digital-sufism.png)

A computer program does not know that it is a computer program.

It does not know that its existence is dependent on many other things that it **does not have control over.**

It needs other written programs for it to execute its written instruction.

In its digital form, it needs hardware to exist. It needs hardware to store its code. It needs hardware to send and receive the data it processes. It needs hardware to execute the tasks that are written for it to do.

In many ways, we are like a computer program.

**Our existence** is dependent on other things that we have no control over.

We exist in the confines of space and time. I am here, you are there. I am writing this then, you are reading this now.

We need air to breathe. We need food to eat. We need water to drink.

All the things we need are dependent on other things, and those things are dependent on other things.

There is an entire cosmos designed by the **ultimate Creator** that in every moment is constantly shifting, moving, expanding. Every element down to a tiny atom has it purpose.

However, unlike a computer program that does not know it is a computer program, **we know what we are.**

**We know our purpose.**

Well, I do, but do you? This program remembers its **Maker**.

_Stay glitch, stay human._
