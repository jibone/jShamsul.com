![AI is a Bubble](/imgs/essays/ai-is-a-bubble.png)

AI at the moment, towards the end of 2025, is a bubble. AI right now is loud, **“AI Powered”** this, **“AI Powered”** that. You see it everywhere.

Every product demo, every pitch deck, every landing page feels compelled to announce it. AI has become nothing but just a buzzword, a marketing hook, a shiny sticker slapped onto products to make them feel current, relevant, and most importantly investable.

The bubble is not the technology itself. The bubble is the attention economy around it. This distinction matters.

We’ve seen this pattern before.

Databases were once exciting. The idea that information could be stored, queried, and retrieved at scale felt revolutionary. Today, databases are boring. That is actually a compliment. No one brags about using a database anymore, everyone assumes there is some sort of datastore that just works.

Search engines were once magical. The ability to type a few words and retrieve knowledge from across the world felt almost supernatural. Now they are the norm. Their absence would be highly inconvenient, but their presence is unremarkable.

Cloud computing was once exotic. A server somewhere far away, doing things you didn’t fully understand. Today, cloud infrastructure is invisible, until it breaks the internet, of course.

This is how technologies mature. They begin as spectacle, evolved into tools. Eventually, they fade into the background.

**AI has not reached that stage yet.**

Instead, we are still in the phase where visibility is mistaken for value. Where the loudest claims receive the most attention. Where novelty is rewarded more than reliability. Where saying “AI” is sometimes more important than explaining why it’s there.

That is the bubble. Not the models, not the research, not the real incremental improvements happening quietly behind the scenes.

The bubble is the belief that a technology must constantly announce itself to justify its existence.

**AI will stop being a bubble when it no longer needs to introduce itself.** When AI becomes invisible, when AI is taken for granted, when AI is boring, that is when you know AI has made it.

When it quietly improves workflows instead of redefining them every six months. When it fades into the infrastructure layer, doing the job without demanding applause. When we stop talking about “AI-powered” products in the same way we no longer talk about “database-powered” websites.

This is not a dismissal of AI’s importance. It’s an acknowledgment of its future. 

The most transformative technologies are not the ones we endlessly debate, they’re the ones we forget are even there.
