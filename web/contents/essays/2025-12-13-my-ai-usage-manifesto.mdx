# My AI Usage Manifesto.

Use AI as augmentation, not automation.

**For coding:**  
Don’t use AI to write your code.  
AI shouldn’t be your coder.  
Make it your sentient rubber duck, a thinking partner that helps you reason.

**Code is something you understand, not outsource.**

**For writing:**  
Don’t let AI write for you.  
AI shouldn’t be your ghostwriter.  
Use it as your personal editor, sharpening structure, clarity, and flow while your voice stays intact.  

**Writing is something you express, not delegate.**

**For media:**  
Don’t rely on AI to generate the final piece.  
AI shouldn’t be your artist.  
Make it your rapid-prototyper, use it to storyboard, explore compositions, and test ideas before you craft the real thing.  

**Media is something you design, not auto-generate.**

Use AI to accelerate your process, not replace your thinking.  
Retain authorship, agency, and taste.
