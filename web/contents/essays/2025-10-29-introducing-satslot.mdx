Remember the **Million Dollar Homepage**?

Back in 2005, Alex Tew built a website that consisted of a million pixels arranged in a 1000 by 1000 pixel grid. Each 10 by 10 block of pixel was sold for $100 each, which makes it $1 per pixel.

I wanted to make something similar, but instead of a million dollars, I wanted the Grid canvas to represent **100 million Sats**, equivalent of 1 Bitcoin. 

That’s how [Satslot](https://satslot.com) was born.

Inspired by Million Dollar Homepage, Satslot is a digital canvas made up of 32 by 32 square, each called a ‘slot’.

Each slot can be acquired via **Lightning payments**, starting at **1,000 Sats for the first 32 slots**. The price increases with every batch of 32.

Once you secure a slot, you can upload an image, name the slot, link it to a website, and write a brief description, and you can update it anytime you want.

I see it as part art experiment and part tech experiment. I want to see what happens when the internet paints together, one slot at a time.

## How it Works

Pick an available slot, and click **“Secure This Slot”**.

Enter in your email address and click on **“Generate Lightning Invoice”**.

**Your email acts as your access key to that slot**. When you want to log in later, simply use the same email to receive a login link, no usernames or passwords.

Emails are stored as one-way hashes, it is hashed together with the slot number and a random salt. There is no way for me to know which email belongs to which slot, or ever what your email is.
  
So make sure you use **an email you control and have access to**.

Once a Lightning invoice is generated, scan or copy the address into your Lightning wallet to complete the transactions.

Once the transaction is completed, you can access the slot by entering the email you used before. A **‘magic link’** will be sent to your inbox, click and follow the link to access your slot.

Inside, you could upload a picture, name the slot, add a website link, and add some descriptions.

Your updated slot will be on the Grid, alongside all the other, making you part of a living, growing digital tapestry.

## Future Plans

This is just a beginning. I won’t pretend that I have a solid roadmap in mind, but I do have some ideas where I want to take Satslot.
  
I wanted **each slot to tell its own stories**, and I want to make it easy for Slot Owners to express that story. I want to build features and tools that enable us to tell this collective story.
  
Hopefully as more slots get purchased, it will incentivise me to build this up more.

There’s currently no official Satslot social media account, but you can follow me for updates or questions on [Twitter (@jibone)](https://x.com/jibone) or [Nostr (@jibone)](https://primal.net/p/nprofile1qqsqsgehv75h9hvla3d39gzh87w5karednhcaj6z3jhy5tmtsxmzgjgpwsmcx).
