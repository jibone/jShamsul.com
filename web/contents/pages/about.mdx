My name is **J. Shamsul Bahri**. Around the web, I often go by the handle *<a href="https://x.com/jibone" target="_blank">@jibone</a>*. A husband to a lovely wife, father to an adorable daughter, seeker of beneficial knowledge, and a builder of software. Born in Malaysia, currently residing in Singapore.

I am a **full-stack Software Engineer** with over 15 years of professional experience building scalable software systems. The recent 9 years I was with <a href="https://grab.com" target="_blank">Grab</a>, the South East Asian ‘super-app’ offering logistical services, ride-hailing, and financial services to the region.

I started my career in software engineering after finishing my studies at **University Tenaga National**, working at a local-based defence contractor specialising in developing, supplying, and maintaining IT systems for the Malaysian armed forces.  Subsequently, I worked with a few local start-ups before I joined **Grab**, which back then was a little ‘start-up’ known as **MyTeksi**. One could say that I used to worked at tech start-ups in the valley, the Klang Valley that is.

I relocated to **Singapore** as Grab relocated its engineering office back in 2015, and have been here since.

This website is my personal space online. It is where I post my thoughts in writing in the hope for posterity.
