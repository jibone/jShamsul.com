My name is **J. Shamsul Bahri**. Around the web you will often see me going by the handle <a href="https://x.com/jibone" target="_blank">@jibone</a>. Husband to a lovely wife, father to an adorable daughter, seeker of baneficial knowledge, and builder of useable software.

I am a **Software Engineer** from *Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia*. Currently I am based on the sunny city of *Singapore*. As a full-stack Software Engineer, I love exploring both the frontend and backend of things.

In my spare time, I love building Lego sets with my daughter, assembling plastic robots figures known as Gunpla, soldering keyboard switches and customizing Machanical Keyboards, and play games on Nintendo Switch.
