- Refactor how mdx files are read for changelog.
- Change the way pages are generated. Removed ContentLayer, now are reading and rendering the pages mdx file directly.
- Switched blog entries to read and render from MDX files directly. Since ContentLayer the project is no longer supported, I've decided to move away from ContentLayer.
